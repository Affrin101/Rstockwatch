Description: Main idea of the package is to provide a very simple interface for checking movements in stock prices in comparison to the market. This will be implemented by accessing public data from Yahoo Finance by selecting a ticker of the stock, range of start and end dates and benchmark for comparison, such as SP500 or NASDAQ. As a result of data processing with pystockwatch package, user will be able to see a plot with two lines showing percentage change since the start date and volumes of trading
