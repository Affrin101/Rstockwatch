# Rstockwatch

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Rstockwatch package is to provide a very simple interface for checking movements in stock prices in comparison to the market. This is implemented by accessing public data from Yahoo Finance by selecting a ticker of the stock, range of start and end dates and benchmark for comparison, such as SP500 or NASDAQ. As a result of data processing with Rstockwatch package, user will be able to see a plot with two lines showing percentage change since the start date and volumes of trading.

## Functions

This package is built with following four functions:  
 - `percent_change`
 Calculation of profit percentage change of a stock for a given period of time based on data extracted from Yahoo finance.  
 - `profit_viz`
 Visualization of profit percentage change trend of a stock against market benchmark for a given period of time. Note that during weekends and public holidays, stock market has no data available, this is handled in plotting as well    
 - `volume_change`
 Calculation of daily trading volume change of a stock, whether it is increasing or decreasing. This data is used in  next function for color mapping of bar plot.  
 - `volume_viz`
 Visualization of trading volume as bar plots colored by changes in volume in comparison with previous day. This plot is overlayed with line plots created with the second function. . Note that during weekends and public holidays, stock market has no data available, this is handled in plotting as well  
 
## Comparison with similar packages in R Ecosystem
There are many packages written for analysis of stock data. One of relevant R package in this category is [quantmod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod), which allows a lot of manipulations with time series data, such as creating moving averages or calculating other parameters for technical analysis. Power of `Rstockwatch` is in its simplicity, so users are not overwhelmed with all extra features and just have a simple view with key comparisons for a stock of interest

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Rstockwatch) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/Rstockwatch")
```
## Usage and Example

After the successful installation of this package user are recommend to restart the R session to update any dependencies packages. The functions in this package require input four parameters: `stock_ticker`, `start_date`, `end_date` and `benchmark_ticker`. Output results are in form of an plot based on "ggplot" package.

Import the functions from package with following commands:

```
library(rstockwatch)
```
